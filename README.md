# QuarantineList
Creating an application that can be used in a quarantine center for storing data of people living there.
An imaginary Quarantine center has 89-411 Room number to quarantine people who have been travelling.
This program allots room(if empty) and store details of person living in it.
Also the person has to leave after 14 days so we have to remove their entries from our data list.
